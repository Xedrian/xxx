Title: Station Production Limiting
Description: Limits production module output. Allows you to slow down or stop production of products that you don't want. Supports individual limits on multiple products from URV Wharf plus Missile and Turret Forges&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;=== How to Use ===&#13;&#10;Select the Station whose production module you wish to limit and click on [b]Details[/b]&#13;&#10;Expand the [b]Production modules[/b] section&#13;&#10;Select the Production module that you want to limit and click on [b]Details[/b]&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;The [b]Production Limiting[/b] section lists all of the wares that this module can produce&#13;&#10;Click on the configuration icon (spanner) to the left of the ware that you want to limit&#13;&#10;Now use the slider in the [b]Production Limiting[/b] menu to set the production limiting or brake factor. 0% does nothing and 100% will stop all production for this module&#13;&#10;Click on [b]OK[/b] to accept the limit or [b]Back[/b] to abandon any changes&#13;&#10;This ware will now be limited&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;To change your mind return to the [b]Production Limiting[/b] menu at any time&#13;&#10;Setting the limit to 0% and clicking on [b]OK[/b] will remove a production limit&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;If you want to use the [b]Configuration[/b] menu then click on the top left icon (spanner) on the [b]Production Limiting[/b] menu&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;=== The Station Production Limiting mod ===&#13;&#10;Allows for limiting of individual production lines on player stations&#13;&#10;Allows different limits to be placed on each production module on each station and across different player stations&#13;&#10;Supports the URV Wharf, Turret and Missile Forges which produce multiple products by limiting one or more of the potential products&#13;&#10;If a product is 100% limited then the production cycle still runs but the production module, on average, produces nothing and consumes nothing&#13;&#10;Reduces consumption of Primary and Secondary wares to go with the reduction in Products&#13;&#10;Multi-lingual with support for Russian, French, Italian, Spanish, English and German&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;=== Setting Limits ===&#13;&#10;A production limit can be set at any time and will return un-needed resources at the start of the running cycle but the product totals (stock adjustment) will only update at the end of the corresponding production cycle&#13;&#10;The Production Limiting menu works in the same way as the Encyclopedia menu and does not show the effect of Product Efficiency (Specialists etc) but it will take that into account when it adjusts the production quantities&#13;&#10;The Production Limiting menu only shows Primary Resources due to space limitations but it will limit the use of secondary resources when it adjusts the production quantities&#13;&#10;As resources cannot be produced or consumed in fractions of units this mod attempts to limits the factor to values that consume and create complete units of wares&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;=== Configuration menu ==&#13;&#10;Lets you dynamically set the Debug level. &#13;&#10;The higher of the Global or Station Debug setting takes effect for that station&#13;&#10;If you set the Global Debug to 1 or 2 and look in the debug log then you will see some additional information that shows what is happening under the bonnet.&#13;&#10;You will need a log file tailing program such as SnakeTail (http://snakenest.com/snaketail) to watch the end of the debug.log&#13;&#10;Lets you log the configuration to the Logbook&#13;&#10;Allows you to remove most of the configuration data that this mod uses&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;=== How it works ===&#13;&#10;This is a work around to the station managers production software&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;It relies on the station manager restocking some wares for it and adjusting the total production at the end of each batch as the production module software doesn't realise that some of its resources have been put back into stock&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;The full set of wares is still needed to start off a modified production cycle.&#13;&#10;Within about 10 seconds of production starting the manager restocks a proportion of the wares which prevents the production module from producing the full amount of product and reduces the wares that it consumes&#13;&#10;At the end of the production cycle the manager has to adjust the stock levels of product as the production module thinks that it has produced more than it actually has.&#13;&#10;The result of the station managers work is to reduce the total amount of a specific ware that is produced and to reduce the wares that it consumes.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;=== URV Wharf, Missile and Turret Forges ===&#13;&#10;These produce more than one product by cycling through the available products.&#13;&#10;The products can be individually limited and the limits can be set at any time.&#13;&#10;The limits for a specific product won't take effect until that product gets to its production slot.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;[url=http://forum.egosoft.com/viewtopic.php?t=385622] Station Production Limiting -
