Title: Repack Construction Vessel
Description: Repack the construction vessel and use it to build another station, to complete a partial station or just sell it. &#13;&#10;I recommend to ignore the plot construction vessel, or sell it if you repack it. Building another URV Forge may bug the campaign.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;This mod also allows you to assign engineers to stations for maintenance and repairs. This feature is based on the Station Engineers mod by w.evans : http://www.nexusmods.com/xrebirth/mods/442/?&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;With the CV departed you can choose if you want to have slow repairs performed by your engineer or deploy the CV and pay for instant repairs.&#13;&#10;Once you install this mod you will receive upkeep missions from all you stations requesting an engineer.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;WARNING:&#13;&#10;It is possible that if you deploy the CV to a fully built station the CV will start rebuilding stage 1 of the first module. This issue doesn't seem to be related to the CV or this mod, but to certain problematic stations.&#13;&#10;Unfortunately there is no known workaround. If you really need to deploy to a fully built station and you have this issue, wait for the CV to finish rebuilding stage 1 and then make sure you finish all upgrades so that you don't need to deploy again.
