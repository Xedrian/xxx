Title: Black Market Seminars
Description: This mod adds each of the available virtual seminars to appear in the trader inventory of black marketeers. Virtual seminars are part of the vanilla game and used the same way. This mod just provides another method of getting them instead of playing the mini game, then the second mini game.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;There is only a small chance for each seminar, and a trader will have at most three copies of any. Seminars are priced between 1 and 2 million credits.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;To use seminars, just view the stats of one of your hired NPCs. If you have a seminar that can be used with that NPC, the &quot;Train&quot; button will be enabled, and selecting that will allow you to select which skill you want to train.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;It's worth noting that only the primary skills of that NPC type are trainable, which are the skills displayed in [b]bold[/b]. The other skills have no impact on the function of that NPC, and cannot be trained. Most common hire-able NPCs (Pilot, Captain, Defence Officer, Architect, Manager) have three [b]bold[/b] skills that can be trained and which affect their performance. Engineers have only the engineering skill in [b]bold[/b]. Specialists vary from one to three [b]bold[/b] skills, depending on their type.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;One caveat is that Marine Officers have three [b]bold[/b] skills, but one of those skills is boarding experience. Since that is an experience based skill, I elected to not include the boarding skill as a buy-able skill, but you can still buy and train the two remaining skills.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Please note that when installing into an existing game, seminar items will not appear until the player changes zones.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Uninstalling is possible by speaking to a black marketeer and asking them to stop selling seminars.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;This is my first mod published, so take care with your save game files. I have been playing with this running for a few days, and haven't experienced any trouble. Compatible with game version V3.61.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Anyway, so let me know what you think, and I hope you find this mod useful.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;You can find the forum discussion here http://forum.egosoft.com/viewtopic.php?p=4542462
